Circuit Description and Functionality

The designed circuit is a CMOS NAND gate, implemented using two PMOS transistors in parallel and two NMOS transistors in series.
When both inputs are high (logic ‘1’), the NMOS network conducts and the output is pulled low (logic ‘0’).
For all other input combinations, at least one PMOS transistor remains ON, pulling the output high (logic ‘1’).
Thus, the circuit performs the NAND logic operation, where the output is low only when all inputs are high.
